2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

Database is used where we need to store, add, change and query information for big chunk of data stored outside of application. Databases are stored in binary format which is not readable by humans, therefore, use text files when the document needs to be read by humans.

3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

 SQL is a declarative rather than a procedural language. We declare what we want to find out, rather than how the database should find it.

4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

Database is structured as a table where rows contain data, columns describe what the this data represent and finally the cell (intersection of row and column) can retrieved or queried by our request.

5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

Table - set of data structured in row and column principle
Row - this is a collection of information
Column - define what the data represent
Value - this is actual information that is stored in table

6. List three data types that can be used in a table.

String, integer, float
